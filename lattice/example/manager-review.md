# Manager Review - FY24

## Manager: Jane Smith
**Director of Engineering**

## Results and Impacts

The employee has demonstrated strong technical leadership and delivered significant impact across multiple projects this year. They successfully led the migration of our legacy authentication system to a more secure and scalable solution, completing the project ahead of schedule and with minimal disruption to users.

Their work on optimizing our data processing pipeline resulted in a 40% reduction in processing time, which has directly improved our ability to deliver timely insights to customers. The employee also took initiative in mentoring junior team members, providing guidance on code quality and architectural best practices.

I've been particularly impressed with their ability to balance technical excellence with practical delivery, ensuring we maintain high standards while still meeting business deadlines.

## Areas for Growth

While the employee excels in technical execution, there are two areas where I'd like to see growth:

1. **Strategic Communication:** The employee could improve in communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. This would enhance cross-functional collaboration and ensure that technical decisions are better aligned with business objectives.

2. **Project Scoping:** Sometimes the employee takes on too much or underestimates the complexity of certain tasks. Developing stronger skills in project scoping and estimation would help them manage their workload more effectively and set more realistic expectations.

## FY25 Goals and Support

For FY25, I recommend focusing on the following development goals:

1. **Technical Leadership:** Continue to strengthen technical leadership by leading a major architectural initiative and mentoring at least two junior engineers.

2. **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Improve collaboration with product and design teams by participating in early-stage planning sessions and providing technical guidance throughout the product development lifecycle.

3. **Communication Skills:** Enhance ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences through regular presentations at cross-functional meetings.

To support these goals, I will:
- Provide opportunities to lead high-visibility projects
- Arrange for the employee to participate in our leadership development program
- Schedule regular feedback sessions focused specifically on communication and collaboration
- Connect them with relevant mentors in the organization
