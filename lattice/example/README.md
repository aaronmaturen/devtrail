# Performance Review Examples

This directory contains example templates for performance reviews and goal tracking. Use these as reference when creating your own performance documentation.

## Files Included

- **goals.md**: Example performance goals with key results and due dates
- **employee-review.md**: Example self-review for annual performance evaluation
- **manager-review.md**: Example manager review for annual performance evaluation

## Usage

These files demonstrate the recommended structure and content for performance reviews. When creating your own reviews:

1. Use the goals file as a template for setting SMART goals with measurable key results
2. Reference the review templates for both self and manager assessments
3. Maintain consistent formatting between mid-year and annual reviews for easier comparison

## Directory Structure

The recommended structure for organizing your performance documents is:

```
lattice/
├── YYYY/                 # Annual review cycle (e.g., 2024)
│   ├── goals.md          # Annual goals
│   ├── employee-review.md # Self-review
│   └── manager-review.md  # Manager's review
└── YYYY-mid/             # Mid-year review cycle
    ├── employee.md       # Mid-year self-assessment
    └── manager.md        # Mid-year manager feedback
```

This structure allows you to track progress over time and maintain a historical record of your performance and growth.
